2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and PixelClkIO_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks PixelClkIO_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and PixelClkIO are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks PixelClkIO]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning

The clock pin pwm0/counter_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning

The clock pin pwm0/counter_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm0/counter_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning

The clock pin pwm0/counter_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm0/counter_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm0/counter_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pwm0/pwm_out_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '2' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
